More US Restaurants Remove Dining Areas

美国越来越多的餐馆取消了就餐区

Dining rooms are disappearing from restaurants in the United States, as Americans increasingly use apps to order food.

随着美国人越来越多地使用app点餐，美国餐厅里的饮食区域正在逐渐消失。

One example is the new Chopt Creative Salad Company restaurant, which opened last week in New York City. It is unlike any of the company's other 61 restaurants. It has no cash registers or dining tables.

举个例子，上周在纽约新开张的Chopt创意沙拉公司餐厅。它不同于该公司其他61家餐厅。这里没有收银机，也没有餐桌。

Atlanta-based restaurant Chick-fil-A has similar locations in two cities: Nashville, Tennessee and Louisville, Kentucky. Customers order and prepay online. They can either go to the store for their meal or have it sent to them.

亚特兰大的福来鸡餐厅在田纳西州的纳什维尔和肯塔基州的路易斯维尔也有类似的分店。客户在线订购和预付。他们可以去商店吃饭，也可以让人打包外送。

Chick-fil-A is also trying something different. The company has announced plans to set up three "delivery kitchens." In all three, Chick-fil-A will share space with other restaurants to prepare food for delivery only.

福来鸡也在尝试不同的方法。该公司已经宣布计划建立三个“外卖厨房”。在这三家餐厅中，福来鸡将与其他餐厅共用空间，只提供外卖食品。

Digital orders are a major growth area for fast-food and fast-casual restaurant chains. More are turning to these dark, or ghost, kitchens to cut costs.

数字订单是快餐和休闲快餐连锁店的主要增长领域。更多的人转向这些黑暗的，或幽灵般的厨房来削减成本。

Wendy's, another fast-food business, announced last month that it aimed to open two "dark kitchens" by the end of the year.

另一家快餐企业Wendy's上月宣布，计划在今年年底前开设两家“黑暗厨房”。

Some food delivery-only operations in New York and San Francisco have failed in recent years.

近年来，纽约和旧金山的一些只提供食品配送的业务经营不佳。

===============================

But in January, Travis Kalanick's CloudKitchens got a $400 million investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, Reuters reported. Kalanick is a co-founder of ride service Uber. The Wall Street Journal first reported the investment earlier this month.

但据路透社报道，今年1月，特拉维斯•卡兰尼克的云朵朵厨房（cloudkitchen）从沙特阿拉伯的主权财富基金获得了4亿美元的投资。卡兰尼克是Uber的联合创始人。《华尔街日报》本月早些时候首次报道了这笔投资。

CloudKitchens, founded in 2016, builds shared food preparation areas for delivery-only restaurants to rent.

云朵朵厨房成立于2016年，为只提供外卖的餐厅提供共享的食物准备区。

Julie Atkinson is the Chief Marketing Officer for Chopt. She says the company offered pick-up and delivery orders soon after it opened 18 years ago. Today those orders make up nearly make up nearly half of its business at larger restaurants, she said.

朱莉·阿特金森是Chopt的首席营销官。她说，该公司在18年前开业后不久就开始提供取货和送货的订单。如今这些订单几乎占了该公司大型餐厅近一半的业务。

"We are sensing a really huge customer need for speed, for convenience," she said. "We're hopeful that this concept really raises the bar on customer convenience."

她说:“我们感到顾客对速度和方便的需求非常大。”“我们希望这个概念真的能提高顾客的便利程度。”

On November 5, coffee house Starbucks opened its first Starbucks pickup store in the United States for online orders. The new store is similar to some new Starbucks stores in China, where digital ordering is more common.

11月5日，星巴克在美国开设了第一家在线订购的星巴克皮卡店。这家新店与中国的一些星巴克新店类似，在中国，网上订餐更为普遍。
