OPEC Nations to Discuss Oversupply of Oil

欧佩克国家讨论石油供应过剩

The world's oil oversupply could continue to rise, causing a drop in fuel and energy prices. That possibility will be under discussion at OPEC negotiations on Thursday.

世界石油供过于求的局面可能会继续加剧，导致燃料和能源价格下跌。这种可能性将在周四的欧佩克谈判中进行讨论。

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will decide whether to continue with production cuts agreed to three years ago.

欧佩克（即石油输出国组织）将决定是否继续维持三年前达成的石油减产协议。

These negotiations take place as tensions increasingly drive OPEC member-nations in different directions.

Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's national oil and gas company, is expected to enter the stock market Friday.

Bhushan Bahree is an executive director of international oil at the research company IHS Markit. If people are already not honoring the current agreement, he asked, why make more cuts?

布尚·巴里是IHS Markit研究公司负责国际油价的执行董事。他问到，如果人们已经违背了当前的协议，为什么还要加大削减石油产量呢？

He said, "I think the Saudi position is they're willing to cut more if needed, but they want better compliance."

他说：“我认为沙特的立场是，如果有需要他们愿意加大削减产量，但是他们希望各成员国更好地遵守协议。”

Currently, OPEC nations have agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day through March 2020. Most experts expect OPEC nations to extend 
those production cuts until at least summer.

欧佩克成员国目前已经同意在2020年3月前每天减产120万桶。多数专家预计欧佩克国家会把减产协议延长到至少明年夏天。

Jacques Rousseau is with Clearview Energy Partners. He said, "If they just keep the existing situation, then you get this massive oversupply." 
He believes OPEC nations will cut production by an additional 400,000 barrels per day to keep supply and demand in balance during the first half of next year.

雅克·卢梭就职于Clearview Energy Partners。他说：“如果欧佩克国家只是维持现状，那么就会出现大规模的供过于求。”他认为欧佩克国家将在明年上半年每天再减产40万桶，从而保持供需平衡。

Rousseau said Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are more likely to make the cuts. But large cuts may be difficult with some OPEC members following their own plans.

卢梭表示，科威特、沙特阿拉伯和阿拉伯联合酋长国可能会减产。但是由于某些欧佩克成员国会遵循自有规划，大规模减产可能比较困难。
