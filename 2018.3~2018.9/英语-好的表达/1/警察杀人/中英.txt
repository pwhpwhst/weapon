A video recorded at the time shows Derek Chauvin, the police officer, kneeling on Floyd's neck for several minutes as he lay on the street. Floyd repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe,” and, “Please, I can’t breathe,” as the crowd asked the officer to stop.

当时录制的一段视频显示，弗洛伊德躺倒在街上，警官德里克・乔文跪在他脖子上好几分钟。弗洛伊德不停地说，“我不能呼吸了”，“求求你，我不能呼吸了” ，当时周围的人群要求警官停止他的行为。

========================================================================

Clouds of smoke still hung over the city Friday morning.

周五早晨浓烟仍笼罩着这座城市。

U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the violence and the city’s mayor, who belongs to the Democratic Party. Trump is a Republican.

美国总统特朗普批评了暴力事件以及该市市长――市长本人是民主党人士。特朗普是共和党人。

The president wrote on Twitter that he would send in National Guard troops to, in his words, “get the job done right” if the mayor, who he described as "weak," failed to restore order. He added, “Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”

特朗普总统在推特上写道，他将派遣国民警卫队“正确地处理好此事”，如果这位“软弱”的市长无法成功维护好城市秩序。他补充道：“无论遇到任何困难，我们都会控制住局势。不过，暴乱开始之时，武力枪击也会随之开始。”

The message led to a warning from Twitter, which said it violated rules about “glorifying violence.”

推特官方给特朗普总统的这条消息做出了警告，称其违反了禁止“赞颂暴力”的规定

Meeting with reporters on Friday, Mayor Jacob Frey defended his decision to evacuate the police station, saying it had become dangerous for officers. He said, “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.”

周五，市长雅各布・弗雷在会见记者时为他命令警方撤离警局的决定进行了辩护，称当时情况对警察来说已构成威胁。他说：“我们的城市在经历很多痛苦和愤怒。这些我都理解……但过去几个小时和几个晚上在这里发生的抢劫行为是不能接受的。”

Across the street from the police station, windows in nearly every business had been broken. The Target department store chain said it would close several nearby stores, including the one heavily damaged in the rioting. One restaurant was burned almost beyond recognition. Other businesses covered their windows and doors.

警局对面的街道上，几乎每家商店的窗户都被破坏了。被袭击的百货连锁店表示，将关闭附近几家商店，其中包括在骚乱中受损严重的一家。一家餐馆几乎被烧得面目全非。其他一些店铺则对门窗采取了保护措施。

Protests in other cities

其他城市也发生了抗议活动

The protests in Minneapolis spread across the river to the city of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Its Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black, wrote on Twitter, “Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again."

明尼阿波利斯的抗议活动蔓延到河对岸的明尼苏达州圣保罗市。该市的黑人市长梅尔文・卡特在推特上写道：“请待在家里。请不要来这里抗议。请把关注点放在乔治・弗洛伊德身上，放在推进我们的运动和防止这种情况再次发生上。”

In New York City Thursday, protesters disobeyed the city’s COVID-19 ban on public gatherings. Some demonstrators clashed with police there. Demonstrators also blocked traffic in Denver, Colorado, and Columbus, Ohio. A day earlier, protesters demonstrated in Los Angeles, California and Memphis, Tennessee.

周四纽约市抗议者违反了该市禁止公众集会的新冠肺炎禁令。一些示威者与警察发生冲突。在科罗拉多州丹佛市和俄亥俄州哥伦布市，示威者聚集导致当地交通阻塞。一天前，抗议者在加利福尼亚州洛杉矶和田纳西州孟菲斯举行示威。

In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night. Protesters there were demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who police shot and killed in her home in March.

在肯塔基州的路易斯维尔，警方证实，周四晚上至少有7人被枪杀。那里的抗议者要求为布雷昂娜・泰勒伸张正义，她是一名黑人妇女，3月份在家中被警察开枪射杀。
