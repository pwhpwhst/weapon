The coronavirus pandemic can be especially difficult for older adults who live alone. To help support them, some American communities and groups have set up
services aimed at meeting their needs for human contact and small talk.

冠状病毒大流行对于独居的老年生活来说尤为困难。为了帮助他们，美国一些社区和团体建立了旨在满足他们与人交流和闲聊需求的服务。

The city of Plano, Texas offers such a program. A group of about 15 city government workers reach out to Plano’s elderly individuals by telephone. 
Now, some residents look forward to getting phone calls from total strangers.

德克萨斯州普莱诺市提供了这样的服务项目。约15名市政府工作人员通过电话与普莱诺的老年人联系。现在，一些居民开始期待接到陌生人的电话。

The idea of getting calls from a stranger - just to chat - was immediately appealing to 81-year-old Dell Kaplan. “It gets pretty lonely here by yourself,” she told The Associated Press.

从陌生人那里打过电话来聊天的想法立刻吸引了81岁的戴尔・卡普兰。她告诉美联社：“一个人在这变得很寂寞。”

Older individuals are more likely than other age groups to get infected with and die from COVID-19, the disease resulting from the coronavirus. 
Because of this, health officials have urged people over 65 to keep staying home even as some areas begin lifting restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus.

与其他年龄段的人相比，年龄较大的人更容易感染冠状病毒并死于由冠状病毒引发的新冠肺炎疾病。因此，即使某些地区开始取消旨在减慢病毒传播速度的限制措施，卫生部门仍敦促65岁以上的人继续留在家里。

Kaplan enjoys the chats while missing out on family get-togethers, dining with friends and attending classes at a nearby college.

卡普兰很喜欢这种电话聊天，毕竟当前无法进行家庭聚会，与朋友一起用餐以及去附近的大学上课这些活动。

Holly Ryckman is one of the government workers taking part in the program. Together they make about 50 calls a week to Plano’s elderly residents. 
“It’s really just to give them a social outlet that they might not have otherwise,” she said.

霍莉・雷克曼是参与该项目的政府工作人员之一。他们总共每周大约向普莱诺的老年居民打50个电话。她说：“这实际上就只是为他们提供一个无法通过其他方式获取的社交渠道。”

Ryckman noted that people receiving the calls have differing amounts of social contact in their lives.
Some like to talk about family members who are keeping in touch. 
That is the case for Kaplan, who said she often speaks on the phone with family members and friends, and also keeps up with people on Facebook.
雷克曼指出，接到电话的老年人在生活中的社交接触程度各不相同。有些人喜欢谈论仍然与其保持联系的家庭成员，
卡普兰就是这样，她说她经常与家人和朋友通电话，并且经常通过脸书与他人保持联系。

But Kaplan said her bi-weekly chats with Ryckman give her something to look forward to “besides the usual.”

但是卡普兰说，她与雷克曼每两周一次的聊天给了她一些“超越寻常”的期待。

Brent Bloechle helped organize Plano’s program. He says the city plans to keep it operating at least through mid-summer, and maybe permanently.

布伦特・布洛希协助成立了普莱诺的这一项目。他说，该市计划将项目至少持续到仲夏，甚至永久性地保持运营。

Another project providing free calls to elderly Americans is the Friendly Voices program. It is a service of AARP, an organization representing the interests of older Americans.

向美国老年人提供免费电话服务的另一个项目是“友好之声”。它是美国退休者协会提供的一项服务。美国退休者协会（AARP）是维护美国老年人利益的组织。

Laurie Onofrio-Collier has been placing calls from her home in California to people across the country. She says her goal for each call is to help the other person “feel uplifted, to feel good.”

劳里・奥诺弗里奥・科利尔一直从她在加利福尼亚的家中拨打电话到全国各地。她说，她每次通话的目标是帮助对方“振作起来，变得更舒心”。

Like the Plano program, Friendly Voices’ volunteers help guide people to resources and local groups if they need help with getting food or other necessities.
But the main goal of the project is to provide a social connection.

就像普莱诺市的项目一样，“友好之声”项目的志愿者会指导有需要食物或其他必需品的人找到资源渠道或当地的相关组织。但这些项目的主要目标是为服务对象提供社交联系。

Onofrio-Collier said the adults she has spoken with talk about a lot of things, from personal interests to happy memories. 
She connected with one caller over a shared experience. “We ended up talking about how ... when we were kids, we loved to read so much that we would read under the covers with a flashlight.”

奥诺弗里奥・科利尔说，她与之交谈的老年人会跟她谈论很多事情，从个人兴趣到人生的快乐回忆。
她还跟其中一个沟通的人分享了共同的经历。“我们谈话结束前谈到了……当我们还是个孩子的时候，我们都非常喜欢阅读，甚至会打着手电筒在被子里看书。”

“I get off the phone with a smile,” she said. Onofrio-Collier is among about 1,000 volunteers making the calls, notes Andy Miller, who works with AARP. He said some people ask for help with technology so they can stay connected with family members.

她说：“我笑着打完了电话。”美国退休者协会的工作人员安迪・米勒指出，奥诺弗里奥・科利尔是约1000名电话志愿者之一。他说，有些老年人要求他们提供技术帮助，以便他们能与家人保持联系。

One volunteer helped a woman learn how to play a game of checkers online with her grandchild. “We’re seeing a lot of that -- where people are just trying to stay connected to family in ways that they probably didn’t do before,” Miller said.

一名志愿者帮助一名妇女学习如何与孙子一起在线玩跳棋游戏。米勒说：“我们见过很多类似的案例――人们想通过以前可能没有用过的方式来与家人保持联系。”



Like the Plano program,the volunteers of "the friendly voices" help guide people to resources and local groups if they need foods and necessities.
