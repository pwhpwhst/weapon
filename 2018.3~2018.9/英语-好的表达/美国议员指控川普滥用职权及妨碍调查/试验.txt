The impeachment process against the president of the United States took another step forward Tuesday in the U.S. House of Representatives.

针对美国总统的弹劾程序周二在众议院又往前推进了一步。

Leading members of the House announced two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. 
The charges include abuse of office for personal political gain and blocking -- or obstructing -- 
the congressional impeachment investigation.

众议院领导层宣布了对川普总统提起弹劾的两项条款。这些指控包括滥用职权谋取个人政治利益以及阻止或妨碍国会的弹劾调查。

The Democratic Party controls the House of Representatives. Trump is a member of the Republican Party.

民主党控制了众议院。川普是共和党的一员。

It was only the fourth time in the 243-year history of the United States that impeachment charges 
have been brought against a president. None of those earlier actions resulted in a president's removal from office.
And Republican lawmakers seem unlikely to support Trump's ouster.

在美国243年的历史中，这只是第4次对总统提出弹劾指控。之前的弹劾行动没有导致任何总统下台。而且共和党议员似乎也不太可能支持罢免川普。

House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler will head the panel that will first consider the impeachment articles. 
He said Tuesday that Trump threatened national security and the 2020 election process by withholding military aid to Ukraine. 
Trump "sees himself as above the law," Nadler added. "He consistently puts himself above the country."

众议院司法委员会主席杰洛德・纳德勒将主持最先审核弹劾条款的小组。
他周二表示，川普通过扣押对乌克兰的军事援助，威胁了美国的国家安全和2020年的选举进程。
纳德勒还说，川普“认为自己凌驾于法律之上，他始终把自己置于国家之上。”

House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff led the weeks-long impeachment inquiry. 
He called the accusations against the U.S. leader "overwhelming and uncontested."

众议院情报委员会主席亚当・希夫领导了为期数周的弹劾调查。他称对川普的指控是“压倒性的而且完全没有争议。”

But Trump has said he did nothing wrong, and none of his Republican supporters in Congress has called for his impeachment and removal from office.

但是川普表示他没有做错任何事情。他在国会中的共和党支持者也没有一个人呼吁弹劾川普并将他赶下台。

Before the articles were announced, Trump criticized the case against him.

在弹劾条款公布之前，川普批评了这起针对他的案子。

"To Impeach a President who has proven through results, including producing perhaps the strongest economy in our country's history,
to have one of the most successful presidencies ever, and most importantly, who has done NOTHING wrong, is sheer Political Madness!" Trump wrote. His message appeared on Twitter.

川普写道：“弹劾一位已经证明了自己的成就，包括创造了我们国家历史上可能最强大的经济，有史以来最成功的总统，最重要的是，他还没有做错任何事，这纯粹是政治疯狂!”他的这些话发表在推特网站上。

Trump added that the president and foreign minister of Ukraine "said, many times, that there WAS NO PRESSURE. Nadler and the Dems know this, but refuse to acknowledge!" he wrote.

川普还补充道，乌克兰总统和外交部长“多次表示没有受到压力，纳德勒和民主党人知道这点，但拒不承认。”

Ukraine investigation

乌克兰调查

Perhaps the most important part of the case against Trump concerns his effort and that of his aides to get Ukraine to investigate former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.
At the same time, the president was withholding $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. The country wanted to help fight pro-Russian separatists in the country's east.

可能这起针对川普的案件最重要的部分牵扯到川普及其助手推动乌克兰调查前美国副总统拜登的努力。与此同时，川普总统扣留了对乌克兰3.91亿美元的军事援助。
该国想要协助打击该国东部的亲俄罗斯分离主义分子。

Nadler said his panel will consider the accusations in the next few days, possibly voting on the articles of impeachment by the end of the week.

纳德勒表示，他的小组将在接下来的几天里审议这些指控，可能会在本周末就弹劾条款进行投票。

That would clear the way for a simple majority vote in the House next week, when Trump is likely to become the third U.S. president to be impeached.

这将为下周在众议院进行简单多数投票扫清道路，届时川普可能会成为第3位受到弹劾的总统。

He would then stand trial in the Republican-majority Senate in January.

然后他将于1月份在共和党占多数党优势的参议院接受审判。
