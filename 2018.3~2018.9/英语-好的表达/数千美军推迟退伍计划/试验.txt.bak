Thousands Delay Plans to Leave US Military

数千美军推迟退伍计划

Antonio Gozikowski was planning to leave the United States Army next month and go to college.

安东尼奥・戈齐科夫斯基原本计划下个月离开美国军队去上大学。

Gozikowski, an Army Sergeant, has served six years in the military. His goal in college was to expand his medical skills, 
become a dentist and then return to the Army in a few years. 
But the coronavirus health crisis is forcing universities to consider online classes or reduced schooling.

戈齐科夫斯基是一名陆军中士，在军队服役6年。他上大学的目标是进修医疗技能，成为一名牙医，然后几年后重返军队，但冠状病毒健康危机迫使大学考虑在线授课或者减少学校教育。

So, Gozikowski decided to sign up for a new Army program and extend his military service for six more months.

因此，戈齐科夫斯基决定报名参加一个新的陆军项目，并将他的兵役期再延长6个月。

Concerns about future jobs or college classes are driving more U.S. military members to either remain in the armed forces or delay leaving. 
The weakened economic conditions make the job security, guaranteed pay and benefits of the military much more appealing.

对未来工作或大学课程的担忧，正驱使更多美军成员留在部队或延期退伍。疲弱的经济状况使军队的工作工资保障和福利更具吸引力。

Gozikowski said, “ Everything from elementary schools to universities is closing down and there’s no saying how it’s going to go when the fall semester opens. ”
戈齐科夫斯基说，“从小学到大学所有学校都在关闭，也没有人说明秋季学期开学后会怎么样。”

He told The Associated Press that the military provides work and guaranteed wages.

他告诉美联社，军队能提供工作和有保障的工资。

Gozikowski is one of hundreds of armed forces members who have accepted short-term extensions being offered by the military. 
As of last week, the Army had already passed its goal of keeping 50,000 soldiers for the fiscal year. 
More than 52,000 have signed up for the extensions. The Navy and other military services also have met or are closer than planned to their target numbers.

戈齐科夫斯基是数百名接受军方短期延期的武装部队成员之一。
截至上周，军队已经通过了为本财政年度保留5万名士兵的目标。已有52000多人报名参加了延期计划。
海军和其他军事部门也已经达到或比原计划更接近他们目标的数字。

The large number of individuals choosing to stay in the armed forces will make up for any shortage in the number of new recruits resulting from the coronavirus
pandemic. That will help the military meet its total required troop levels for the end of the year.

这些大量选择留在军队的人将弥补因冠状病毒大流行而造成的新兵人数短缺，这也将有助于军队达到年底所需的总兵力水平。

Army Sergeant Major Stuart Morgan provides career guidance to armed forces members. 
He says the Army’s program lets members postpone their departure for up to 11 months. By early last week, he said, 745 soldiers had signed up.

陆军中士斯图尔特・摩根少校为武装部队成员提供职业指导。他说，军队的延期计划允许士兵推迟11个月退伍。他还说到上周初已有745名士兵报名。

“What we’re seeing this year, which is directly related to COVID, is we do have a population of soldiers that what they were expecting 
at the end of transition has suddenly disappeared,” Morgan said. “And now you have a soldier that is trying to go through a transition period 
that is now facing uncertainty on the outside.”

摩根说：“今年由新冠肺炎引发的境况的确导致一批士兵原本期盼的过渡期结束后的愿景突然落空。
现在我们有了一些面临着外界不确定性的正在经理过渡期的士兵。”

The U.S. Air Force is already expecting to fall short of its recruiting goal by as much as 5,800 because of the virus. 
The Air Force said that shortfall could be filled by individuals who decide to extend their military service.

由于冠状病毒，美国空军预估距离其招募目标或有多达5800人的空缺。美国空军表示，这一缺口可能由决定延长兵役期的那些个人填补。
