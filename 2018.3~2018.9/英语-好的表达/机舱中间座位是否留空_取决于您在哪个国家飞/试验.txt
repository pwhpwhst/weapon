Empty Middle Seat? Depends on Which Country You Are Flying In.

机舱中间座位是否留空 取决于您在哪个国家飞

For years, travelers have gotten used to low-cost flying on planes filled with passengers. 
But, like everything else, the coronavirus will change their expectations.

多年来，旅客们已经习惯了在满载乘客的飞机上低成本飞行。但是，和其他一切一样，冠状病毒将改变此种期望。

Feng Xueli from Beijing took a flight within China recently. The airplane was full because it was permitted under Chinese rules.

来自北京的冯学礼（音译）最近乘飞机在中国境内飞行。由于中国解封，这架飞机允许满员载客。

“We needed to wear a mask during the flight,” he said. “You also need to go through a lot of temperature checks and security checks when you leave the airport.”

他说：“飞行期间我们都需要戴口罩。离开机场时还需要进行多次体温检查和安全检查。”

Travelers, airlines and airports are dealing with the different rules put in place during the pandemic. The rules are different in almost every country.

旅客、航空公司和机场都在执行大流行期间下达的不同条例规定。几乎每个国家的规定都不一样。

In Thailand, you cannot have food or water on the airplane and you must wear a mask. In Malaysia and Indonesia, the plane needs to be half-empty. In the United States and Europe, airlines are not required to leave the middle seat open. This means passengers cannot keep social distance.
 
在泰国，乘客不能在飞机上吃东西或喝水而且必须戴口罩。在马来西亚和印度尼西亚，飞机只能乘载一半乘客。美国和欧洲并未强制要求航空公司留空中间座位，而这意味着乘客或将无法保持社交安全距离。

The last time there were big changes in air travel was due to the 2001 attacks in the United States. Travelers “understood the security requirements that came after 9/11,” said Boeing vice-president Mike Delaney. He added that international airlines need to work together to decide on the new rules for flying.

上一次航空旅行发生重大变化还是2001年美国的袭击事件引发的。波音公司副总裁迈克・德莱尼说，乘客们“理解911事件后的安检要求”。他补充道，国际航空公司需要共同努力，决定新的飞行规则。

Airline service is changing too.

航空服务也在改变。

Business class meals were once a reason to pay for the higher level of service. 
Now, those meals are not much better than economy class as airlines such as Emirates, Air Canada, and British Airways cut costs. 
And Qantas Airways now ask passengers to check in online to limit contact with employees and other fliers.

商务舱餐费曾经被用以支付更高水平的服务。现在，由于阿联酋航空公司、加拿大航空公司和英国航空公司削减了成本，这些餐食并不会比经济舱好多少。
澳洲航空现在要求乘客在网上办理登机手续，以减少与员工和其他飞行人员的接触。

Empty Middle Seat?

中间座位留空?

On the airplane, one of the biggest questions has been whether the middle seat should be empty.

飞机上面临的最大问题之一是中间座位是否应该是空的。

That means airlines would only fill 65 percent of the seats on a plane with passengers - not enough to make money without increasing the cost of the seats.

这意味着航空公司只能将飞机上65%的座位出售给乘客――如果不提高机票价格，将无法盈利。

Afif Zakwan recently took a Malaysia Airlines flight within the country that was not required to fly half-empty.
He said he was not worried while on a short, in-country flight, but he would not fly internationally for now.

阿菲夫・扎昆最近乘坐了一架马来西亚航空公司在该国境内的航班，且航班无需留空一半的座位。他表示，并不担忧国内短途飞行，但目前他不会乘坐国际航班进行国际旅行。
