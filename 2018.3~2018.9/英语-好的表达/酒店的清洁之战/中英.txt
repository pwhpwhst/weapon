More Hotels Competing on Cleanliness

酒店的清洁之战

As the United States eases coronavirus restrictions and reopens for business, big hotel companies are competing on cleanliness.

随着美国放宽对冠状病毒的各种限制并重新开放经济，大型酒店纷纷展开了清洁之战。

At the end of May, hotel stays in the U.S. were down 43 percent compared to May of 2019, reported market research business STR.

据市场研究企业STR报道，截至5月底美国酒店入住率与去年同比下降了43%。

As more people travel, hotels consider increased cleanliness measures in an effort to make visits more appealing to the public. The companies also see a chance to get back business from competitors, such as the home-sharing company Airbnb.

随着越来越多的人开始出行，酒店希望通过提升清洁力度来吸引公众入住。酒店也希望借机从竞争对手手中夺回业务——比如共享房屋租赁公司爱彼迎。

Larry Yu is a professor at George Washington University’s School of Business in Washington, D.C. He said some hotels are stricter about cleanliness than others. But stronger measures for cleaning operations are happening everywhere.

拉里•余是华盛顿特区乔治•华盛顿大学商学院的一名教授。他表示，某些酒店对清洁的要求比其他酒店更严格，但事实上各地都在采取更有力的清洁措施。

“Everybody is doing it, because it is now expected by consumers,” he said.

他说：“大家都在这么做，因为这符合当下消费者的预期。”

David Whitesock recently moved from Colorado to New York. He stayed in hotels in Iowa and Ohio along the way. “I felt like it was a safe place to be, that they had done the best that they possibly could given the circumstances,” he said. “A lot of it comes down to: do you trust the hotels and the people who you are going to come into contact with there?”

大卫·怀特索克最近从科罗拉多搬到了纽约。路上他在爱荷华州和俄亥俄州的旅馆均有停留。他说“我觉得（旅馆）是安全的，在当前情形下他们已经尽了最大努力。现在很多事情都归结为：你信任酒店吗？以及你会在那里接触到什么人?”

Albert Ko says visiting hotels is still risky even if they have established more protective measures. Ko is a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Yale University’s School of Public Health in New Haven, Connecticut. Hotels can bring together people from states and countries where disease rates are higher, for example, and many people may not show signs of infection.

阿尔伯特·科表示，即使酒店制定了很多的保护措施，但入住酒店仍然有风险。科是康涅狄格州纽黑文耶鲁大学公共卫生学院的一位流行病学和医学教授。比如，酒店会将来自高风险国家和地区的人聚在一起，而许多人可能没有感染的迹象。

 “That’s the kind of thing that we’re worried about in terms of public health,” he said. “These settings can be the cause of outbreaks.”

他说：“这是在公共卫生方面我们担心的问题。这些因素或会引起疫情爆发。”

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky thinks guests will prefer separate homes to hotels filled with people. Airbnb will continue to expand and improve its cleaning measures, he said.

爱彼迎首席执行官布莱恩·切斯基认为，比起住满了人的酒店，顾客应该更想要独立的房屋。他表示，爱彼迎将继续扩大并改进其清洁措施。

“Health and cleanliness are going to be one of our biggest focuses,” Chesky said.

切斯基则表示：“健康和清洁将是我们最重要的关注点之一。

But Yu said hotel companies can make sure their sites are meeting cleanliness requirements through their normal auditing process. That could be more difficult for Airbnb. Yu noted that the company has rules on cleanliness in place, but might have more trouble than hotels in making individual Airbnb operators obey those rules.

但余先生表示，酒店可以通过正常的审核流程来确保其入住地点符合清洁要求，但这对爱彼迎来说可能就比较困难了。余先生还指出，该公司已经制定了有关清洁方面的规定，但在让爱彼迎个体运营商遵守这些规定方面可能要比酒店麻烦一些。
