该指南还建议错开人们的上下班时间，并利用视频会议开会，支持人们进行在线交换名片。

The idea is to avoid offending possible business partners or customers.

在日本交换名片是一项精心计划的仪式，外国商界领袖通常都会专门进行学习。这样做的目的是避免冒犯潜在的业务合作伙伴或客户。

The ritual involves taking out a new card from a card holder - not a coat pocket or wallet, then exchanging cards with the right hand. 
After that, each person looks at the received card while making small talk, often about the information on it.

这种仪式需要人们从名片盒中取出一张新卡，注意不是大衣口袋或钱包中，然后用右手进行卡片交换。然后，彼此都看着手中接到的卡片进行闲聊，通常都是聊卡片上的信息。
