Spain Urges Tourists to Come Back in July

西班牙呼吁游客7月回归旅游

Spain urged foreign visitors on Monday to return starting in July, as the country eased one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns. But many tourism businesses still worry about saving the industry’s summer season.

周一西班牙敦促外国游客从7月开始前来旅游。西班牙曾是欧洲封锁最严的国家之一，如今封锁措施已有所减轻。但旅游业人士仍在担心能否挽救该行业的夏季旺季。

The world’s second-most visited nation closed its businesses and beaches in March to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Overseas visitors had to be placed in quarantine for two weeks. But a government statement said that requirement will be lifted beginning July 1.

今年3月，作为世界第二大旅游国的西班牙封锁了其商业贸易和海滩，以应对新冠肺炎大流行。海外游客必须被隔离两周。但一份政府声明表示，这一要求将从7月1日起取消。

“The worst is behind us,” said Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya on Twitter. “In July we will gradually open Spain to international tourists, lift the quarantine, ensure the highest standards of health safety. We look forward 2 welcoming you!”

“最糟糕的时期已经过去了，”外交部长阿兰查・冈萨雷斯・莱亚在推特上说。“7月份我们将逐步向国际游客开放西班牙旅游业，解除检疫，并确保最高标准的卫生安全防护。我们期待着您的到来!”

Spain usually has about 80 million visitors a year. Tourism makes up more than 12 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and an even bigger share of jobs. So the summer season is important to hold off the possibility of an economic recession.

通常西班牙每年会接待8000万游客。旅游业占国内生产总值(GDP)的12%以上，在就业中所占比例更大。因此，夏季对于延缓经济衰退来说显得尤为重要。

Restaurants and bars in Madrid and Barcelona were permitted to open outside spaces on Monday, but only at 50 percent capacity. Many businesses stayed closed as owners weighed the value of serving just a few people.

周一马德里和巴塞罗那的餐馆和酒吧获准在室外开放营业，但只允许接待50%的客容量。许多企业仍在关门歇业――业主们还在权衡仅为少数人服务是否能够盈利。

Some of those who did open were not very hopeful.

那些开门营业的人也并没抱很大希望。

 “It’s complicated, we are not going to be able to save the tourist season, unless (enough) foreigners come,” said Alfonso Gomez, a restaurant owner in Barcelona.

巴塞罗那一家餐馆老板阿方索・戈麦斯说：“情况很复杂，除非有足够多的外国游客，否则我们无法挽救旅游旺季。”

On the streets, people enjoying new-found freedoms were more cheerful. “It’s nice just to feel a bit of normality again after so long,” said Rosie, a writer and Barcelona resident.

在街上，再次享受到自由让人们倍感愉悦。巴塞罗那居民同时也是一位作家的罗西说：“过了这么久，能再次感受到正常生活的氛围真的很高兴。”

Most students in Spain still need to study online. But some schools reopened in the northern Basque area. Returning students had their temperatures checked and wore face masks.

西班牙的学生大多数仍需要在线学习。但巴斯克北部地区的一些学校已经重新开学。返校学生会接受体温检查并需要佩戴口罩。

Spain has reported more than 28,000 coronavirus deaths and over 235,000 cases. However, the country has seen the number of daily deaths drop to fewer than 100 for the last week.

据报告西班牙有23万5千多例感染病例，2万8千多例死亡病例。不过过去一周，该国每天的死亡人数下降到不足100人。

The hope of foreign tourism beginning in July raised shares of tourism-related stocks, including major hotel operator Melia Hotels.

7月份开始开放国际旅游业的希望使得旅游类股票上涨，其中包括知名的梅利亚酒店。

The country’s tourism industry is receiving the largest amount of state-supported aid meant to help businesses. The state credit agency ICO says tourism-related businesses have received 6.4 billion euros out of 38 billion in assistance provided in recent weeks.

旅游业是该国援助经济发展资金的最大来源。该国的国家信贷机构ICO称，在最近几周提供的380亿欧元援助中，旅游业相关的企业获得了64亿欧元资助。
