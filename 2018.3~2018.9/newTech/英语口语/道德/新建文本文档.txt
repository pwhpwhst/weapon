This issue of ethics in the workplace is of vital importance.
In today's competitive market,any company without a coherent ethics policy cannot possibly survive.
They would certainly loss their competitive advantage to their rivals.







The issue of ethics shoud be put int company development programmes for all employees,from the shop floor to boardroom.
Company should offer training course,lectures,case analysis to make sure that all staff act in compliance with highest standards.








Integrity will surely create wealth.If you act with integrity in bussiness,
you can enjoy good reputation and a good public image.That would keep good people in your employ, 
and keep customers coming back for your products and services.






Companies should not just seek profit only,they also have social obligation,or what is called corporate socical responsibility.
They should be concerned with the well-being of the society,
They're responsible for environmental protection and unholding the principle of integrity.





No,I don't think bussiness and ethics clash.Indeed,good ethics means good management.
If companies ignore moral conceran,violate laws or act unethically,they cannot possibly survive,let along making any profits.
