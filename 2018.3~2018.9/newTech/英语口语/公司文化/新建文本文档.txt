I think the essence of a company culture should include:teamwork,mutual respect,commitment and integrity.
These code values will help to create a healthy environment,and attract more talented people.In turn,
it will keep us one step aheand of the competition.




In my eyes,corporate culture can be observed from such elements as core values and beliefs,
corporate ethics,rules of behavior,customer relationship and wellbeing of the employees.
Besides,it can alse be expressed in the company's architectural style,
interiort decor of offices and by what people wear to work and by how people address each other,etc.





It can affect their employees in many different ways:the way employees interact with each other,
the training  and the skill development they recive,their chances of career advancement,the environmnet they work in,
the benefits and facilities they get,etc.












Yes.I think it's important for a company to employ people with skills
